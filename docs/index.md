## What’s Velly?

### Background

We are huge fans of raspberry pi and have been using it for a variety of local network servers and even as a desktop pc.  There was a need to be able to provide customized images that had software pre-installed to easily share software to friends and family, and so this system was created.

### Overview

The Velly system stores and organizes raspberry pi image links in order to easily download and install system software.  Once a [download] is complete, [installing] it to a usb or sd card is very easy.
